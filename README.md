My 7th task for google code-in 2019. A program in python which converts a unit from one to another in the same physical quantitiy.
Physical Quatity that are used in the program are:-
Length:
 you can change or add values that are not present by writing the unit and it relation with metre in the file "lengthConversiontable.csv".
  method of writing :
    <unit>,<converion factor(relation with metre)>
      for example: i)cm,100
                  ii)km,0.001
Mass:
you can change or add values that are not present by writing the unit and it relation with kilogram in the file "massConversiontable.csv".
  method of writing :
    <unit>,<converion factor(relation with kilogram)>
      for example: i)kg,1
                  ii)g,1000

Pressure:
you can change or add values that are not present by writing the unit and it relation with pascal in the file "pressurehConversiontable.csv".
  method of writing :
    <unit>,<converion factor(relation with pascal)>
      for example: i)torr,0.0075
                  ii)bar,1e-5
